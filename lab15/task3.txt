Lab 3: Environment Variables

Write a script which asks the user for a number (1 or 2) which the script will use to determine whether an environment variable will be set to yes or no, then set the environment variable and export it. Tell the user what needs to be entered when the script starts. Check to see if the user put in a number. If not, set the environment variable to unknown.
