Lab 2: Working with Files

Write a script that will ask the user for a directory name, which the script will create. Change the working directory to the new directory and tell the user where you are using the pwd command. Next use touch to create a few files followed by displaying the filenames. Use echo and redirection to put some content into the files and show the user the content. Finally, say goodbye to the user to end the script.
